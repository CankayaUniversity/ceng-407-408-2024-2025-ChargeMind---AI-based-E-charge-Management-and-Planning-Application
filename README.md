## ChargeMind 

### Project Description
Since electric car usage escalates, issues with charging and shifting customer needs draw spotlight on the need for innovation in this field.Adoption of electric vehicles is now hindered by severe inefficiencies in pricing, route planning, and congestion monitoring.

Our mobile app is intended for owners of electric vehicles and seeks to improve e-charging by making it more effective and convenient. Based on traffic volumes, it recommends the best charging locations along the user's path and balances variables like price and availability of time.Furthermore, by utilizing cutting-edge image processing technology, the app determines which kind of charging is best for the car, avoiding problems like improper connections or charging losses. The software gives consumers an enhanced experience by combining AI-driven image processing with other cutting-edge technology.
